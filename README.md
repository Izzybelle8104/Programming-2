# Overview

Here I showcase my labs and projects from my Programming Fundamentals II course taken in Spring 2024 :)

# Labs

## 1. Data Visualization:
My first project, it prompts users to input data and  visualize it in both tabular and graphical formats, offering an appealing visual for their data. Users can input data points consisting of strings and associated integer values, with the option to stop inputting at any time. I utilized error handling with try and catch, the program validates input to ensure accuracy and provides helpful error messages for incorrect entries.

## 2. Classes:
This project provides an introduction to object-oriented programming in C++, focusing on writing classes and utilizing special functions like copy constructors, assignment operators, and destructors. By simulating a car dealership scenario, the program involves creating three classes: Vehicle, Showroom, and Dealership. Each class serves a specific purpose, from storing vehicle information to managing showrooms and dealership operations. 

## 3. Pointers and Operator Overloading:
I designed and implemented a database system for storing contact information efficiently. By utilizing a ContactBook object and a Contact class, I ensured that duplicate contacts across multiple devices were minimized, optimizing memory usage. This project provided valuable hands-on experience in memory management and demonstrated the effectiveness of pointer-based data structures in optimizing resource usage for large databases of contact information.

## 4. Stacks and Queues:
I implemented my own Array-Based Stack (ABS) and Array-Based Queue (ABQ) data structures. These fundamental data structures follow distinct principles - the ABS adheres to the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) property, while the ABQ follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. By designing and coding these structures, I gained practical experience in understanding how data is stored and accessed in different contexts.

## 5. Binary File IO:
I implemented a program to load and display specific data from binary files containing information about space ships and their attributes, such as length, warp speed, and equipped weapons. Unlike text-based files, binary files require special handling for reading and processing data. Through this assignment, I gained experience in working with binary file I/O and developed algorithms for efficiently searching and retrieving specific criteria from the loaded data.

## 6. Inheritance and Functors:
I developed a set of classes to model bank accounts, employing concepts of inheritance and polymorphism to achieve functional bank account representations. Additionally, I created classes that utilize multiple inheritance, along with implementing the main function (main(int argc, char** argv)) and a functor. 

# Projects

## Linked List:
I worked with data structures where I designed and implemented a Linked List. I created a flexible data structure capable of accommodating any data type by using templates. I utilized nodes for dynamic memory allocation, creating a linear and smooth process for data storage.

Key Features:

* Utilized dynamic memory allocation and pointers
* Non-contiguous memory organization characteristic of Linked Lists.
* Efficient traversal and manipulation algorithms to enhance the performance and versatility of the data structure.


## Image Processing:
The project focuses on manipulating binary image files, specifically TGA files, using C++. The aim is to implement algorithms for reading, modifying, and writing these image files, thereby creating a command-line interface for users to perform various image manipulations.

Key Features:

* Reading and writing TGA files in C++
* Implementing image manipulation algorithms such as Multiply, Screen, Subtract, Addition, and Overlay
* Handling data types and clamping to prevent overflow during operations


## Minesweeper Game:
I made the classic Minesweeper game showcasing a blend of strategy and logic. This project presents a fully functional rendition of the beloved game, where players navigate a grid filled with hidden mines, using clues to uncover safe tiles while avoiding explosive hazards.

Key Features:

* Used SFML functions to and event handling
* Intuitive user interface for revealing tiles and flagging potential mines along wiht interactive windows
* Implementation of logic rules for revealing adjacent tiles and calculating mine counts
* Enhanced gameplay experience with features like timer tracking and mine counter
