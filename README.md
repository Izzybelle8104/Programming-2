## Projects



# Image_Processing
The project focuses on manipulating binary image files, specifically TGA files, using C++. The aim is to implement algorithms for reading, modifying, and writing these image files, thereby creating a command-line interface for users to perform various image manipulations.

Key Features:

* Reading and writing TGA files in C++
* Implementing image manipulation algorithms such as Multiply, Screen, Subtract, Addition, and Overlay
* Handling data types and clamping to prevent overflow during operations


# Minesweeper_game
Dive into the classic Minesweeper game implemented in C++, offering a blend of strategy and logic. This project presents a fully functional rendition of the beloved game, where players navigate a grid filled with hidden mines, using clues to uncover safe tiles while avoiding explosive hazards.

Key Features:

* Used SFML functions to and event handling
* Intuitive user interface for revealing tiles and flagging potential mines along wiht interactive windows
* Implementation of logic rules for revealing adjacent tiles and calculating mine counts
* Enhanced gameplay experience with features like timer tracking and mine counter
