# Image_Processing
The project focuses on manipulating binary image files, specifically TGA files, using C++. The aim is to implement algorithms for reading, modifying, and writing these image files, thereby creating a command-line interface for users to perform various image manipulations.

Key Features:

* Reading and writing TGA files in C++
* Implementing image manipulation algorithms such as Multiply, Screen, Subtract, Addition, and Overlay
* Handling data types and clamping to prevent overflow during operations
